# unkamlafied-avro
An attempt at working around Avro's clunky Phoenetic Typing

This is a simple dictionary file that uses Avro Keyboard's autocorrect functionality to fix/"unkamlafy" (kaman acan) alot of common words with proper replacements.

# NOTE : This is still unfinished and suggestions/help is needed

# Installation

1. Click the "Gear" icon on Avro's topbar (Right-click > "Tools" incase of system-tray icon)
2. Goto "Avro Phonetic Options" > "Edit/Import Autocorrect entries..."
